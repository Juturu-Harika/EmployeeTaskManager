# 🧑‍💼 Employee Task Tracker System

A console-based Java application to manage employees and their assigned tasks, demonstrating core and advanced Java concepts including OOP, Collections, Generics, Exception Handling, Streams, and Multithreading.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ✅ Add and store employees dynamically
- ✅ Assign tasks to employees with due dates and priority
- ✅ View tasks by employee
- ✅ Sort tasks by priority or due date
- ✅ Search tasks by keyword
- ✅ Identify tasks due tomorrow
- ✅ Identify employees with > 3 pending tasks
- ✅ Background thread to monitor and log overdue tasks every minute
- ✅ Robust error handling using custom exceptions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Java Collections (List, Map, Stream API)
- Generics
- Threading (`Thread`, `setDaemon`, `sleep`)
- Exception handling with custom exceptions
- Simple console-based UI with `Scanner`

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run

### ✅ Step-by-step

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-task-tracker.git
   cd employee-task-tracker
````

2. **Compile**:

   ```

3. **Run**:

   ```bash
   java -cp out EmployeeTaskTrackerSystem.EmployeeTaskApp
   ```

## 🧪 Sample Input/Output

```
===== Employee Task Tracker Menu =====
1. Add Employee
2. Add Task to Employee
3. View Tasks for Employee
...
Choose an option: 1
Enter Employee ID: 101
Enter Employee Name: Alice
Enter Department: IT

Choose an option: 2
Enter Employee ID: 101
Enter Task ID: 501
Enter Description: Prepare report
Enter Priority: 5
Enter Due Date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2025-06-15

Choose an option: 3
Enter Employee ID: 101
Task{id=501, desc='Prepare report', status=PENDING, due=2025-06-15, priority=5, assignedTo=Alice}
```

Also, every 60 seconds, background thread logs:

```
[TaskMonitor] Checking for overdue tasks at 2025-06-08...
[OVERDUE] Task{id=...} | Assigned to: Bob
```

## 📘 Java Concepts Used

| Concept                | Usage                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OOP**                | `Employee`, `Task`, `TaskManager`, `TaskMonitor` classes                |
| **Generics**           | `TaskRepository<T>` handles both `Employee` and `Task` types            |
| **Collections**        | Used `List`, `Stream`, and `Collectors` for filtering and sorting       |
| **Exception Handling** | Custom exception `TaskNotFoundException` with graceful error handling   |
| **Streams & Lambdas**  | For filtering, searching, mapping, and grouping task data               |
| **Multithreading**     | `TaskMonitor` is a daemon thread that checks overdue tasks every minute |
| **Encapsulation**      | Getters/setters in model classes, internal list management              |

## 🧰 Future Enhancements

* 💾 Save and load tasks/employees from file or database (e.g., SQLite or JSON)
* 🌐 Web interface using Spring Boot or JavaFX GUI
* 🔔 Email notifications for overdue tasks
* 🔐 Role-based access (Admin vs Employee)
